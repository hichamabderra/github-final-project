## About
This project is maintained by a micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide financial opportunities to low-income individuals. By offering a simple interest calculator as open-source code, we aim to encourage community collaboration and to enhance our development process by transitioning to Git and GitHub.

The main objectives of this repository are:
- To host and manage code for calculating simple interest.
- To adopt open-source best practices, including a code of conduct and contribution guidelines.
- To make the repository available to the community under the **Apache License 2.0**.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.
- A Python interpreter if the script is written in Python (or other runtime if a different language is used).

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-interest-calculator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd simple-interest-calculator
   ```

## Usage
To use the simple interest calculator, run the following command:
```bash
python simple_interest_calculator.py
```

This script calculates simple interest based on user inputs. The formula used is:
\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]
Where:
- **P** = Principal amount
- **R** = Rate of interest
- **T** = Time in years
